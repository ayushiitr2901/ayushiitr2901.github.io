		<p>If you have never been a big fan of anime, chances are, you probably think about Dragon Ball or Naruto when you hear the word “Anime”. Fairly enough, Dragon Ball and Naruto are two immensely popular series that had a huge impact not only on the anime industry, but also on how the world perceived anime as a whole. Moving on from Dragon Ball and Naruto you might be able to name a few more popular series such as One Piece, Bleach, Attack on Titan and Fullmetal Alchemist.
			 All great shows that have been watched and loved by generations of anime fans around the world. And all these shows have one thing in common: they’re all aimed at a younger audience. The most prominent reason as to why these younger audience anime, officially labeled “shonen” anime, manage to break through the bounds of popularity and reach the vast majority of TV viewers, is because they’re aimed at kids. Animation has always been associated with childhood, immaturity
			 and basic morality. And unless you take time to dig deeper and watch more consciously, popular shonen shows mostly seem to abide by the laws of “basic cartoons” with energetic protagonists, explosive action scenes, lively scores and colorful designs. And for seemingly operating within their expected style and appeal, shonen anime are widely accepted and deemed appropriate.
			But something the vast majority doesn’t know is that behind the facade of colors and energy, shonen anime cater a lot more food for thought than you’d expect from a typical work of animation. And something that the vast majority won’t anticipate is that beyond the border of shonen anime is an entire medium of entertainment, varying in their targeted demographic, sometimes philosophical, sometimes hilarious, sometimes emotionally devastating but not any less brilliant than the greatest movies, TV shows or books the world has come to admire.
